HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
formats, such as SAM, CRAM, VCF, and BCF, used for high-throughput sequencing
data.  It is the core library used by samtools and bcftools.

See INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Compressed File Formats Note
============================

Many of these file formats and associated index formats are compressed,
which in this implementation involves the use of system or external
compression libraries such as zlib.  Hence the exact bytes in compressed
files output by HTSlib may vary across different compression libraries or
with different compression level settings, so tasks requiring byte-for-byte
equivalence across repeated runs should compare decompressed file contents.
